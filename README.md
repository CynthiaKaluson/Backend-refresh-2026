# Backend Refresh 2026 🚀

This repository documents my focused 2-month backend development refresh and portfolio rebuild using **Python** and **Django REST Framework**.

The goal is simple:  
to transition confidently into **international backend internships and junior developer roles** by building real, production-style APIs instead of tutorial projects.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Rebuild backend fundamentals with hands-on practice
- Design and implement scalable REST APIs
- Apply real-world backend patterns (auth, permissions, analytics, scheduling)
- Maintain consistent GitHub activity
- Produce interview-ready backend projects

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Framework:** Django & Django REST Framework  
- **Authentication:** JWT  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (SQLite for local development)  
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Postman  
- **Deployment:** Render / Railway (later stages)
